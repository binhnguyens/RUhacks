Transcript:  MIT received so that you can receive and interpret and exchange data exchange. You can have conversations with things around you so i i t allow multiple physical objects like the tim tams to be connected to the internet but I can send just how good tim tams on throughout the tim tams and to you and I can receive just how many people want those damn Tim Tam and I can have a conversation with the other items in your fridge
Transcript:  so we're doing a very exciting time we will have chaise couches everything that's in your phone connected to the internet or at least I have conversations with things around you now still very ominous ride and we have a definition that may or may not in dictionary but let's sections
Transcript:  Hardware little bits and pieces like this
Transcript:  the hardware is what actually allows us to connect digital items to physical objects so I can put this on the door and it will tell me when that door opens this is a Dollar by the way
Transcript:  so we have Hardware that senses thinks we have data
Transcript:  thought I actually starts to make sense of what it is and it's something we push around all the time every day that we don't really think about but for example this piece of hard way he can create TCG. It tells me how fast my my heart is beating what's actually check that out right now yeah hundred 10th grade and essentially this is also changed over the last 10 years we use to push dollar Rand in heavy on a standardized format through seeing a lot of different ways of doing this now we see each eye some strings so you interpret that monkey Json and now. Are saying Lena we can say more with less like I and daughters become Elite universal language not English Chinese novels land
Transcript:  but the universal language of things and software we do once we have that communication what we have that piece of information the software is what interprets what controls it it's what analog is it allowed to do stuff it's Facebook it's your Instagram it's the things that actually type pieces of data from these pieces of hardware and makes it through stuff that is valuable to you and the lost it without all of this stuff is it wasn't connected it wouldn't mean anything at connectivity over the last 10 years we've seen guy from cellular phones that was a size of bricks 3 to Wi-Fi to ethernet to 2G GSM 4G this is an RF transmitter this is a dollar fifty an attached this one of these sentences with this little bit in the middle and I can stop beaming information to other things around me with no one going cost with electricity costs
Transcript:  is $0.01 a month for one of these and I can start to have a conversation in a language that is not English or all is well
Transcript:  but in Dora
Transcript:  and once we have all of these things connected and get it up to the clown like these things here we can actually talk to you soon the thing on the top left.

Transcript:  enter $4 I can also put it outside and know when my girlfriend get time that she got safely through the valley and into my pop on the bottom left is an air quality sensor this is on the top end of the costly Electronics but that's a $6 sensor that allows me to tell is there ammonia is there carbon dioxide or harmful gases in the environment around me and in the middle a galvanic skin response system this allows me to measure the conductivity in my skin down to the micro level where I can know before my brain does that I'm stressed that I go to drenalin pumping
Transcript:  order on stage and on the right we have consumers versions of these up to the $10 Mark that allow anyone in that harm to stop building the systems I'm talking about out-of-the-box using software that's readily available
Transcript:  it's all in the wonderful Cloud we can do it anyway we can do it too ultralight cost we don't have to worry about maintaining it and you don't have to be an expert to use it
Transcript:  then you may or may not know that this already exists in your arm and if it doesn't you should already have it the systems that allow us to walk up to a front door and not use a key but purely to actually measure is Jordan man has he walked up in a particular way that him and unlock the door for me I can send my TV on to channel 7 in The Simpsons just as I get high and I like 2 in the afternoon I could actually measure how many people are in my room what's the humidity what's the temperature outside and automatically set my air conditioning I can talk to a unit and turn my Philips Hue Lights on at the right time for the right I left my mood

Transcript:  he thinks having the same job for 10 years even worse
Transcript:  where in France stage with everything will be connected in the impact Society will be 11 trillion dollars a year by 2025 across factories Cities human identification in healthcare work sites and general safety offices in vehicles and why now because of the ultra low-cost of this hard way the high availability of resources the lower level of difficulty to compile them and put them together and a highly digital and connected universe that is driving us towards not disconnecting a digital space in a digital lives but a physical space and the things we actually deal with everyday
Transcript:  this is a vertical Farm the only human interaction needed is placing the seeds into the soil watering trimming harvesting sold taken care of by RT systems
Transcript:  and fossil in a smart City over the last 10 years has made one of the most IRT integrated smart cities in the world by placing senses that tell people where parking spots are they've increased revenue for parking to 50 / 50 million dollars per year
Transcript:  they've decreased the energy caused by 37 million dollars a year. By having anxiety in lights to tell them when they actually need to turn it on and when people are there to use them this smart Goblin 758 million dollars in water usage just by wandering in the right places at the right time and now think about your home all those things I mentioned in your house already doing mine it's here it's not a futuristic object or an idea it's a reality
Transcript:  so as we welcome the whole universe to the next era of connectivity I asked once all about half the automated when the things that we currently do everyday in the jobs at Hobby Lobby and thought of you guys are actually replaced by iot devices artificial intelligence and interconnected systems what do we do
Transcript:  we come back to creativity Innovation and Humanity we cannot replace I need to create new things to improve them and to build interpersonal relationships we invent we build we optimize we operate we invite and we remember to enjoy sometimes before we invent again is the beginning of a new era
